# FlashCardApp

Flash Card App is a web application, originally inspired by my desire to study french with flash cards. In this website, the user will be able to create and store 
multiple flash card decks, and then have the option to study the decks flash card style. This application is a project meant to sharpen my skills in javascript, html, 
and css/bootstrap css. **Note: project is currently unfinished and in progress**
